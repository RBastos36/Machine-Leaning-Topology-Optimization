## Key Features


## Prerequisites

The following versions were used on the main version of this work:

- Python 3.12
- NumPy 2.2.2
- SciPy 1.15.1
- PyTorch 2.7.0
- Matplotlib 3.10.0
- CVXOPT 1.3.2
- H5py 3.13.0
- tqdm 4.67.1

## Dataset

Inside the `dataset-creation` directory, several scripts for multiple topology optimization problems can be found, such as cantilever beams, MBB beams, L-brackets, and other variations with holes inside the domain. For the current work, the cantilever beam with diagonal loads (`topopt_cholmod_cantilever_beam_diagonal_load.py`) was parameterized to generate the dataset. 

These scripts are based on the Python framework built by Anderson et al. (2011), which was later adapted by [Niels Aage and Villads Egede](https://www.topopt.mek.dtu.dk/apps-and-software/topology-optimization-codes-written-in-python) to optimize its Finite Element Method solver by using Cholesky factorization (CHOLMOD solver).

This topology optimization dataset referenced in this work is available on [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15243092.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15243092).


This cantilever beam dataset has 9 240 information groups, totaling 119 812 data instances. It was parameterized by changing:
- Volume fraction.
- Load's relative position on the right edge.
- Horizontal Load Magnitude.
- Vertical Load Magnitude.


## Machine Learning Architecture

5-channel input tensor with: domain density distribution, loads in _x_- and _y_-directions, and constraints in _x_- and _y_-directions.

2-channel output tensor with: displacements in _x_- and _y_-directions.

Best performing architecture: U-Net
